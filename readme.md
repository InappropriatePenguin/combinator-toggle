# Combinator Toggle

A small [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod that allows vanilla and modded constant combinators to be toggled using a hotkey (by default: F). Generates different sound cues for each state. Respects player reach. You can download it from the Factorio [Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/combinator-toggle).
